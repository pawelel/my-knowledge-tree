## About Typescript

Typescript is a strongly typed language, created and maintained by Microsoft as subset of JavaScript. It compiles to JavaScript. It is supported by all major libraries and frameworks.

Typescript is used by Vue, React, [[coding/Angular\|Angular]].

It keeps application free from type errors, undefined and null values.



To install typescript on Windows, you can use command:

```powershell
npm install -g typescript // installs typescript globally
```

Global option reduces the risk of appearing this error:
>[!ERROR] tsc: The term 'tsc' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.

If you want to run code made in typescript (e.g. `name.ts`), first convert it to javascript by using `tsc` command. Then you can type and execute `node name` command, which will execute converted JavaScript code.

Before using boolean in TypeScript, you need to assign a value to it. Other way you'll get an error.
