This book of [Huy Tran â€“ 72 Tricks for .NET Developers](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Py6KEAAAQBAJ&pli=1) helped me to realize, how much I am missing in my programming education.  
I've found exactly 20 tips out of 72, those about the debugging and one about the conditional placement I feel they are what I need most to learn:

- print screen
- reorder parameters
- duplicate code analysis
- conditional breakpoint
- conditional placement
- Exchange browser requests between computers (HAR from Dev Tools)
- External tools in Visual Studio
- Tracepoints an alternative to `Console.WriteLine()`
- Keep browser console and network when refresh the website
- Update value while debugging
- Control the debugging flow
- See value without hover while debugging
- Code coverage scan
- Restore recent closed tab in Visual Studio
- Tab customization in Visual Studio
- Enable force push
- Enable word wrap in Azure DevOps
- Sync databases
- Debug your website on a real mobile device
