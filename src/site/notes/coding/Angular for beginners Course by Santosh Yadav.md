The host tried to convey as much as possible, but the video is not divided into sections on the bar, which makes it very difficult to find yourself in the thread when returning to the topic. Fortunately, in the description there is a list with links to the topics covered. The course is partly similar to creating an application, but adding, removing, changing the concept many times, losing the thread, no cuts in case of mistakes makes the video  unbearable and difficult to follow after a few hours.
