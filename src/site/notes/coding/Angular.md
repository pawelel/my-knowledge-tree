Angular is a component-based UI framework build with [[coding/Typescript\|Typescript]] by Google.
It features:
- templates
- data binding
- forms
- routing
- observables
- PWA

Angular also supports server side rendering (SSR).

## Installation
In order to install Angular 13, use command:

```powershell
npm i @angular/cli@13.2.1 -g
```
If you want to create simple workspace without additional components, use:

```typescript
ng new workspacename --create-application false
```
To create app, you can use command
```typescript
ng new applicationname
```
To create component:
```typescript
ng g c componentname
```
- ng - angular
- g - generate
- c - component

To run application locally, use:
```typescript
ng serve -o
```

## Mono-repo
You can have multiple applications and libraries in one workspace. Applications can share code, which reduces repeating.

## Using variables
In Angular you can use interpolation with double curly braces:
```typescript
<h1>Hello {{variableName}}</h1>
```
You can also use HTML properties with variables:
```typescript
<div [innerText]="numberOfRooms"></div>
```
Which is an equivalent of JavaScripts:
```javascript
document.getElementById('numberOfRooms').innerText = numberOfRooms;
```
## Events
Angular uses `banana syntax` in event names (rounded braces):
```typescript
<button (click)="toggle()">Toggle</button>
```
