## EN

Your professional life could be described as a set of areas, that is:

- What `you are good` at  
- What `you love doing`  
- What the `World needs`  
- `What pays`  

Image below describes those areas as circles. If any of them is excluded, it might cause some consequences.  
If you won't like the things you do at work, you will `feel empty` and wish to `quit` job.  
If you are not good enough in your tasks, you will be `uncertain and miserable`.  
If your labor don't provide income, you can `end up broken`.  
If the world doesn't need the things you do, you'll `feel useless`.  
If you earn money and are good in your job, it is `profession`  
If you earn money and do what the World desires, it is `vocation`  
If you love your job and are good at work, it is `passion`  
If you love your work and it's fulfilling World's needs, it is `mission`
