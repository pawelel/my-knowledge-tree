You can use neuroplasticity to create sense of your own security
Use `fact`, `activate` your positive emotions with a thing that makes you happy and `experience it`, then install the feeling in your brain - `embrace it`. If the experience is meaningful, you can name it.  
For example:  
If there is a fresh air outside, feel its humidity, temperature, embrace the refreshing feeling for at least 30 seconds. The longer an experience lasts, the more it becomes fixed in the brain.
If dancing with someone makes you feel happy, remember that moment and emotions from it.
