Goals can be improved by implementig the SMART Goals method, which is an acronym form `Specific`, `Measurable`, `Achievable`, `Relevant` and `Time bound`.

#### **Specific**

simple, sensible, significant  

- `What` do I want to accomplish?  
- `Why` is this goal important?  
- `Who` is involved?  
- `Where` is it located?  
- `Which` resources or limits are involved?  

#### **Measurable**

meaningful, motivating

- `How` much?
- `How` many?
- `How` will I know when it is accomplished?

#### **Achievable**

agreed, attainable

- `How` can I accomplish this goal?
- `How` realistic is the goal, based on other constraints, such as financial factors?

#### **Relevant**

reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based
A relevant goal can answer "yes" to these questions:

- Does this seem worthwhile?
- Is this the right time?
- Does this match our other efforts/needs?
- Am I the right person to reach this goal?
- Is it applicable in the current socio-economic environment?

#### **Time bound**

time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive

- `When`?
- `What can I do` six months from now?
- `What can I do` six weeks from now?
- `What can I do` today?
