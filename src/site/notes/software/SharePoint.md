SharePoint is a web-based collaborative platform that integrates with Microsoft Office. It uses web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to provide a user-friendly interface. SharePoint is primarily sold as a document management and storage system, but the product is highly configurable and usage varies substantially among organizations. SharePoint is often used as a platform for intranet and enterprise content management (ECM) as well as business process automation.
