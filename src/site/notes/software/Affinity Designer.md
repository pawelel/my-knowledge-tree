## How to save Text frame settings in Affinity Designer

Those methods allow you to save (not only) Text frame settings.

### 1. Change default settings of the frame text (not recommended)

### 2. Save an object with text frame settings as group in Assets

Assets can have text frame set individually, which makes them more efficient.
